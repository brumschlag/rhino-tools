Building in visual studio
==================

The AssemblyInfo.cs is missing from the repository. The reason for that is that the build is generating updated AssemblyInfo.cs files for all projects,
with the correct version and revision notes.

You need to run:
 > msbuild buildall.build 
 
from the command line before you can build in visual studio.
